-Create Vicinity type pool. Takes monitor IP and port as arguments.
-Destroy pool is no-op currently (no need to clean-up state)
-Start/stop block volume. Can only specify volume name and size currently.
An external script is called to handle these operations. Assumption: devices
are activated prior to running this.

*All operations are done through virsh
*Virtmanager UI does recognize vicinity pools/volumes created through virsh, but cannot
be used to modify them.
